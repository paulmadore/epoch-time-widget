# epoch-time-widget
My first attempt at a GTK application.

To run: 

You can either execute src/main.py or run the epoch_time.bin file from /bin. If you run into an error running epoch_time.bin, ensure that it is executable -- chmod +x epoch_time.bin. Currently, for the image to display inside the button, you must have the binary in a tree beneath /res, and /res must include clock.png. Working on this. Give me time. So for example, I have a ~/programs folder from which I run epoch_time. I also now have a ~/res folder with clock.png inside of it.
